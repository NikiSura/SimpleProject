Asks user to either enter a word or quit

Stores the word in a scanner object called scan

If the String does not equal q, the linearSpellCheck method will be run using the
parameter word

  linearSpellCheck will loop through each word in dictionary.txt and return a
  true or false value depending on whether or not the word is found in the list; 
  the method will also print the number of words it has checked before assiging the
  boolean value

    If the word is found using linearSpellCheck, a statement will print saying the word
    is spelled correctly
    
    Else a statement will be printed out saying the word is mispelled
    
Else (when a q is entered) the scan will close
